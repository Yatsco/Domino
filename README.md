I could not finish making the modular version of the
text game and had to use the finished nonmodular
version.

The GUI is much more modular than the Text game, but
I still had to add many specific methods to the GUI.

I needed to try and follow my design diagram more.




TEXT:
Things I still needed to add
Making the program more modular
assume the player can types anything else than
what is given (I think the player can type other things
except for when it asks for left or right).
Numbers for each domino


GUI:
Manual flipping for pieces that match on both sides
(mainly a problem with zero dominos)
Things I still needed to add
Better left or right implementation
Better visuals for the dominos








Known Bugs
I had the game lock up on me at the
when the boneyard was zero once and could
not replicate the problem I think it had something to
do with the AI.
game still prints out a lot of errors in the console 
after the game ended and a domino is selected



How to play

Text
Select a domino 0-6 (for starting hand)
enter 'y' or 'n' if you dont want to place that domino
enter 'l' or 'r' depending if you want to place the
piece on the left or right
enter 'y' or 'n' if you want to flip the piece

GUI
Click on the domino on the board you want to play
click the clickbox if you want to focus more on
playing on the right side
